Hello 👋🏻
I had so much fun working on this personal project! My goal was to practice and improve my coding skills, so I decided to build an accordion application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The accordion is perfect for displaying longer explanations of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript terms in an organized and easily accessible way. I was also excited to try my hand at adding animations using lottie. To top it off, I added the current time and date to the application, which was a fun challenge to tackle. I can't wait to see how I can build upon this project and maybe even use it as a starting point for future projects with different colors and fonts.

Here is the [Live link](https://vlado-languages.netlify.app) of the project 😊
